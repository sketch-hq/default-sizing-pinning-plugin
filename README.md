# Default Sizing & Pinning

Small Sketch plugin to migrate layers in top-level frames to post-Athens defaults:

- Sets width/height to Fixed if currently Relative.
- Sets pins to both Top and Left.

The plugin can be run for the current page, or for all pages in the document.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Itâ€™s only necessary to run this on old documents first opened with Athens [v2025.1](https://www.sketch.com/changelog/2025-1/) or [v2025.1.1](https://www.sketch.com/changelog/2025-1-1/). Frame contents in documents first opened with [v2025.1.2](https://www.sketch.com/changelog/2025-1-2/) or later will already be migrated with to these defaults.

## Installation

1. Download `default-sizing-pinning.sketchplugin.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/sketch-hq/default-sizing-pinning-plugin/releases/latest) and extract.
2. Double-click the extracted `.sketchplugin` file, or drag it into Sketch.
